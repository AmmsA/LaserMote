#### Motivation
Laser-mote is a system for tracking a laser pointer as an input mechanism for interacting with different network-connected devices. In this system, a processor and a camera is placed to capture the environment in which the user will interact with using a laser pointer. Any area of the environment can be defined by the user as a valid interaction spot. Pointing the laser at these pre-defined areas of the environment can trigger the system to preform different actions.

A user defines the defined ROIs (region of interests) at the setup stage and is reasonable for defining what sort of action is desired when a gesture is recognized within the ROI.
